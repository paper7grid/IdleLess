This app analyzes traffic patterns and idle-heavy times using publicly available datasets to help reduce unnecessary emissions and time lost in traffic. Our goal is to visualize when and where cars tend to idle the most and provide actionable insights.

### Why This Matters:
- Car idling contributes to **greenhouse gas emissions** and **fuel waste**.
- Understanding idle patterns helps city planners improve traffic signal timing.
- Drivers can save money and time by avoiding peak idle periods.

### Data Notes:
- Idle time estimates are simulated from airport traffic data for demo purposes.
- Real implementation would use APIs like **OpenTraffic**, **Bay Area 511**, or **EPA emission datasets**.
