This app focuses on traffic idle patterns in **San Francisco (SF)** and **Fremont**, visualizing the hours of the day when idling peaks. This helps drivers make better choices and highlights unnecessary fuel waste.

### üöó Why This Project?
- Even short idle periods add up across a city.
- Knowing peak idling times helps reduce traffic pollution.
- Local focus on **SF** and **Fremont** keeps it realistic and manageable.
